            <h2>About.</h2>
            <p id="bio">My hobby is to play fun games that challenge me and grow my understanding of the game. My favorite game is Brawl Stars. In Brawl Stars, you have to unlock brawlers and get trophies by playing those brawlers in matches for rewards. I play many other games too, like Monster Legends, Clash of Clans, Clash Royale, and more games. Most of the games I play are by a company called Supercell, who make many games that are loved by many people.</p>

            <p>My Inspiration to play gaming was Youtube. I used to watch Youtube a lot when I was younger, and when the topic of gaming popped up, I decided to watch it. Because of that, it made me want to play. After I downloaded and played some games, I really liked it because it was fun. But specifically, KairosTime inspired me to play my favorite game, Brawl Stars. KairosTime is a brawl stars youtuber who has over 700k subscribers. One day, I want to be a brawl stars youtuber and play.</p>
